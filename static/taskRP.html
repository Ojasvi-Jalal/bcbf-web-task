	        <h1>Your RaspberryPi Mission!</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Program your robot car to be maneuverable and intelligent.</p>

	        <p>To get a real taste of how fun technology can be we have set you a mission that allows you to learn programming
	        and exercise your creative problem solving abilities. Over the two weeks you will be tasked with solving the above
	        mission using the Python programming language. We have provided you in pairs a Raspberry Pi Car Kit that comes with
	        a selection of sensors that allows you to perform a range of different tasks. The idea is your robot will be able to
	        go around multiple tracks, follow various lines and avoid obstacles.
	    	  </p>
	        <p>We have included some checkpoints below to help you track your progress and ensure you can complete the mission!</p>

	        <h3>Checkpoints</h3>
	        <ol>
	            <li>Get car moving in one direction from A to B</li>
	            <li>Get car moving in multiple directions</li>
	            <li>Get car moving automatically</li>
	            <li>Get car to follow a line</li>
	            <li>Optimise your robot to beat the competition!</li>
	        </ol>

	        <h3>Competition:</h3>
	        <ul>
	            <li>Fastest line tracking robot</li>
	        </ul>
	        <br>On the final day of the programme, you will go head to head against all the competiting teams, in order to get your robot around the track in the fastest time! There will be high hopes, a lot of excitment and some great strategies... who will be the reigning champions for this BCBF 2019 event!

	        <h3>Logistics</h3>
	        <ol>
	            <li>Grouped in teams of 2-3</li>
	            <li>Use laptop with remote connection to RPi</li>
	            <li>Learn & explore, ask questions & write code!</li>
	        </ol>

	        <p>There are no constraints as to how you program the robot, be creative and have a lot of fun! Good luck!</p>
